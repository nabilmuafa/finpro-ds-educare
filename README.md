# Paris Housing Machine Learning App
### by Kelompok 4 Workshop DS EDUCARE

This machine learning web application was made for the final project of **EDUCARE's Data Science workshop**. In this machine learning app, we used samples from Paris Housing Dataset from Kaggle (Playground S3E6) to train the model. Using XGBoost as the model, this machine learning app will predict house prices for the features inputted by the user.

_Please do note that as students, we are still learning. This machine learning model might not be the best model out there, but this is the best we've tried to do._
